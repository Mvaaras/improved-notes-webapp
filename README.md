# improved-notes-webapp
A web app for keeping and organizing personal notes. You can test the app [here](https://online-notes-mv.herokuapp.com/)

## Current functionality
* Users will be able to register/log in and create personal, semi private notes
* Notes can be tagged on creation, and notes can be filtered by tag. One note may have multiple tags.
* Notes can be deleted and edited by the user who created them

Most of the important functionality is now working as intended, though there are still some issues with the app I'd like to work on before it's finished. I'd like to add the ability to edit tags after a note has been created. Additionally I'd like to improve the layout. I am not sure if this kind of app actually needs note sharing or administrators (as those are not functions I would personally need), which is why I have not worked on those yet.


## Original plans for app functionality
* Users will be able to register/log in and create personal, semi private notes
* Notes can be edited or deleted by the user who created them
* Tags can be added to notes to organize them. Notes can be filtered by tag. One note may have multiple tags.
* Notes can be shared to other users, but they can't edit or delete them.
* Notes can also be set to public, which will make them appear on user's profile.
* Other users' profiles can only be viewed by regular users searching for a specific username
* Administrators can view all registered users, registration date and  and delete their accounts


*I am making this project because keeping organized, somewhat private notes is something I often want to do on multiple devices at once, and I feel a web app like this would be really useful for me.*
