# improved-notes-webapp
A web app for keeping and organizing personal notes. You can test the app [here](https://online-notes-mv.herokuapp.com/)

## Current functionality
* Users will be able to register/log in and create personal, semi private notes
* Notes can be deleted by the user who created them

While the app is still somewhat bare bones, the core functionality is already in place (as most other things detailed in the original plan is "extra embelish") and the app is coming along nicely. In the following weeks I intend to add more of the original plans and create a better visual layout for the app.


## Original plans for app functionality
* Users will be able to register/log in and create personal, semi private notes
* Notes can be edited or deleted by the user who created them
* Tags can be added to notes to organize them. Notes can be filtered by tag. One note may have multiple tags.
* Notes can be shared to other users, but they can't edit or delete them.
* Notes can also be set to public, which will make them appear on user's profile.
* Other users' profiles can only be viewed by regular users searching for a specific username
* Administrators can view all registered users, registration date and  and delete their accounts


*I am making this project because keeping organized, somewhat private notes is something I often want to do on multiple devices at once, and I feel a web app like this would be really useful for me.*
