# improved-notes-webapp
A web app for keeping and organizing personal notes

* Users will be able to register/log in and create personal, semi private notes
* Notes can be edited or deleted by the user who created them
* Tags can be added to notes to organize them. Notes can be filtered by tag. One note may have multiple tags.
* Notes can be shared to other users, but they can't edit or delete them.
* Notes can also be set to public, which will make them appear on user's profile.
* Other users' profiles can only be viewed by regular users searching for a specific username
* Administrators can view all registered users, registration date and  and delete their accounts


*I am making this project because keeping organized, somewhat private notes is something I often want to do on multiple devices at once, and I feel a web app like this would be really useful for me.*
